        <h2>Travel Tips from a Guy Who has Made Every Mistake Imaginable</h2>
        <p><small>Published October 16, 2019</small></p>
         <p class="article">Spend a minute on any travel blog, and you'll find millions upon millions of articles full of travel "pro-tips".  Since I'm sure all you avid blog-readers are expert travelers, I want to offer a few pieces of advice that <em>should</em> be common sense, but might slip between the cracks of all of your planning.  I personally have made every one of these mistakes before, so don't be like me - follow this advice and you'll be feeling nice!</p>

                <h3>1. Double-Check ALL Date and Time Information</h3>
                <img src="images/missed-flight.jpg" class="article-image" alt="Man missing flight">
                <p>This certainly seems like a no-brainer, but that's exactly why it deserves to be reinforced!  There is no worse feeling in the world than arriving at the airport to find out that your plane to Japan departed at 2am, not 2pm as you were expecting, or to see that you accidentally booked your hotel room for July instead of June. </p>

                <p>To make your scheduling more efficient, double check all dates and times as soon as you make the booking. Add them to your digital calendar, if you aren't using a service which does so automatically.  Try making a habit out of this, and avoid ever having to make that dreaded phone call telling your friends and family why you won't make the wedding in time!</p>
                
                <h3>2. Download Google Maps of the Area you're Traveling to in Advance</h3>
                <img src="images/google-maps.jpg" class="article-image" alt="Google Maps">
                <p>If you won't be able to to use your phone plan abroad, or don't intend to buy a local temporary SIM card, we're fortunate enough to live in a world which is WiFi-a-plenty!  However, you won't always have access to a connection while you're in transit.

                <p>In those circumstances, you'll be extremely grateful if you managed to download a digital map of the area on Google Maps in advance.  This will help you identify landmarks and roads, while helping you get oriented in your city more easily.  Check <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en">this link</a> for more information on how to do that!  You can also "pin" important locations (like your hotel!) for easy access.  It's also worth noting that even if you do not have mobile data in a region, Google Maps can still track your location via GPS through the Google Maps app, which is as helpful as it is terrifying.</p>
                
                <h3>3. Don't Forget Sunscreen!</h3>
                <img src="images/sunscreen.jpg" class="article-image" alt="Applying Sunscreen">
                <p>The average American spends very little time outside, and is rarely exposed to the sun for periods of time longer than it takes to walk to your car. We are used to applying sunscreen only under very deliberate circumstances, such as going to the beach, or a day at the pool.  Walking is a major part of traveling, and if you use a step counter, you're likely to find that the steps you take while abroad are <em>significantly</em> higher than those which you do at home.  An application of sunscreen in the morning will keep you feeling fresh.</p>
                    
                <p>Take it from me, the only thing worse than a six hour flight is a six hour flight with sunburns running across your body!</p>

                <h3>4. Consider Renting Out Your Place</h3>
                <img src="images/airbnb.jpg" class="article-image" alt="Renting out your home can save a lot of money">
                <p>When I say I'm a low-budget traveler, I mean, I'm really a <em>low-budget traveler.</em> For better or worse, I'm always trying to stetch my dollar as far as it'll go.</p>

                <p>While living in Shanghai, one tip that I found to be effective was <a href="airbnb.com/host/homes">listing my own apartment on AirBnB</a> for the duration of my trip.  Some people might find this very unappealing for obvious reasons.  For me, I was able to completely negate all housing expenses on my trip and even make a little extra on the side while visiting the Philippines in 2016.  Just make sure to be upfront to potential guests that this is your current living quarters, <em>clean your home thoroughly for your guests,</em> and don't leave anything of high value in your home. </p>
                
                <h3>5. Have Fun!</h3>
                <img src="images/laughter.jpg" class="article-image" alt="Strong in the face of adversity">
                <p>I mean, it is always the number one rule, right?</p>
                
                <p>Look, this can be easy to forget.  Many people even choose to avoid traveling altogether because they associate it with all of the potential negatives.  The stress induced when something goes wrong, the high cost, <em>long</em> plane rides- it never ends!  </p>
                    
                <p>Sometimes traveling can seem like more trouble than it's worth.  However, travel, like all things in life, is about mindset.  If you go into it worrying about things outside of your control going wrong, you're going to make yourself miserable.  If you can change your attitude to learn to laugh at the absurdity of things not going as planned, and stay adaptive, you're going to learn a valuable lesson that you could take with you anywhere you go in life. </p>

        <p>That's all I've got for now!  Simple stuff, but good to keep in mind.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for more entries!</p>
